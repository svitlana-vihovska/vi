1.bottom-up integration is first tested all the software modules that make up the system, 
and then they are combined for integration testing. with this approach, the localization of errors 
is greatly simplified: if the modules are tested separately, the error in their joint work is the problem 
of their interface. with this approach, the tester’s problem search area is quite narrow, and therefore the 
probability of correctly identifying a defect is much higher. the disadvantage is the need to develop drivers 
and plugs for integration testing.

3. I didn’t have to test api before, so happy to learn how to do it.


Error 404 - HTTP response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server cannot find the data according to the request.
Error 503 occurs when the queue length reaches a certain value, the server stops receiving new requests
To check the API Availability, I would check the performance testing (load, stress, stability). I would also use the Postman application for this test.
